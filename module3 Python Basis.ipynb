        "--> Python is Computer program use to write code for both simple and large projects. It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is mainly poluplar for its readablity, simplicity, and versatility.\n",
        "More reasons for it's popularity are explained below:\n",
        "\n",
        "a) Simplicity and Readablity: Python uses simple english for syntax, and therefore it is easy to understand even for beginners. Same reason give it flexiblity to the developers to focus on problem rather than on complex code structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "b) Rich eccosystem of libraries: It has a lot of third party libraries that  extend it's functionality. eg Pandas( for data cleaning etc), Numpy (for data reading), Matplotlib (data visualization) and many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "c) Community Support: It has a massive global community of Data scientist, data engineers, developers, etc, who all have created a huge wealth of resources in the form of tutorials, forums etc that help to solve problem more efficiently and upskill onself.\n",
        "\n",
        "d) Versatility: Python is not only useful in data analytical dimention, but also it  is used for development in machine learning, automation, artificial intellegent. i.e can solve many small and big probles in world. This is the most versatile programig language so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "e) Free and open source: It is free and thus available to all. So, anyone can contirbute to it and also, therefore acdepted by academics and industries as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "f) Integration Compatiblity: it is compatible with other computer languages, like C++ and Java, and therefore can be used to develop complex systems  "
